d12n.eu is a work in progress Jamstack website that I'm currently rebuilding with TypeScript and the React Framework Next.js. It runs on netlify.com and it is connected to the content cloud @ sanity.io. Testing takes place on GitHub Codespaces.
The website aims to deliver content in the field of political science, with a primary focus on the European Union and Civic Education.
